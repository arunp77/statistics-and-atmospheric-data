    "\n",
    "The t-test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. There are two main types of t-tests: \n",
    "1. the independent samples t-test and \n",
    "2. the paired samples t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent Samples t-Test:\n",
    "The independent samples t-test is used to compare the means of two independent groups. The null hypothesis is that the two groups have equal means, while the alternative hypothesis is that they have different means.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the independent samples t-test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\n",

    "\n",
    "The independent samples t-test assumes that the variances of the two groups are equal. If they are not, a modified version of the t-test called Welch's t-test can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paired Samples t-Test:\n",
    "The paired samples t-test is used to compare the means of two related groups, such as before and after measurements of the same group. The null hypothesis is that the mean difference between the two groups is zero, while the alternative hypothesis is that the mean difference is different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the paired samples t-test is:\n",

    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "After calculating the t-value and degrees of freedom, the p-value can be obtained from the t-distribution table. If the p-value is less than the significance level, then the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, indicating that there is not a significant difference between the means of the two groups.\n",

    "## 2. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to determine whether there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups. It tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal, against the alternative hypothesis that at least one group mean is different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANOVA test is based on the F-statistic, which is calculated by dividing the variance between the groups by the variance within the groups. The F-statistic follows an F-distribution with degrees of freedom based on the number of groups and the number of observations.\n",
