    "# Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, is the branch of statistics that deals with drawing conclusions or making predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. It involves using probability theory to estimate population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion) from sample statistics (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) and testing hypotheses about the relationship between variables. Inferential statistics aims to make generalizations about the population based on the information obtained from the sample.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main uses of the Inferential statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics is used to make generalizations and predictions about populations based on sample data. Some of the main uses of inferential statistics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Estimation:** Inferential statistics can be used to estimate population parameters (such as the mean or proportion) based on sample data.\n",
    "2. **Hypothesis testing:** Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses about population parameters using sample data.\n",
    "3. **Prediction:** Inferential statistics can be used to make predictions about future observations or outcomes based on past data.\n",
    "4. **Generalization:** Inferential statistics can be used to generalize findings from a sample to the larger population.\n",
    "5. **Decision-making:** Inferential statistics can be used to support decision-making in various fields, such as business, medicine, and social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, inferential statistics allows researchers to draw conclusions about populations based on sample data, which can be used to make informed decisions and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of estimates\n",
    "There are two important types of estimates you can make about the population: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Point estimates:** A point estimate is a single value estimate of a parameter. For instance, a sample mean is a point estimate of a population mean.\n",
    "2. **Interval estimates:** An interval estimate gives you a range of values where the parameter is expected to lie. A confidence interval is the most common type of interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of estimates are important for gathering a clear idea of where a parameter is likely to lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing is a formal process of statistical analysis using inferential statistics. The goal of hypothesis testing is to compare populations or assess relationships between variables using samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypotheses, or predictions, are tested using statistical tests. Statistical tests also estimate sampling errors so that valid inferences can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical tests can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Parametric**: parametric tests are considered more statistically powerful because they are more likely to detect an effect if one exists. Parametric tests make assumptions that include the following:\n",
    "        - the population that the sample comes from follows a normal distribution of scores\n",
    "        - the sample size is large enough to represent the population\n",
    "        - the variances, a measure of variability, of each group being compared are similar\n",
    "        - Example: t-test, ANOVA, Regression analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
    "        - **t-test:** Used to compare the means of two groups when the data are normally distributed and the variances of the two groups are equal.\n",
    "        - **ANOVA:** Used to compare the means of three or more groups when the data are normally distributed and the variances of the groups are equal.\n",
    "        - **Regression analysis:** Used to model the relationship between two or more variables when the data are normally distributed and the assumptions of the model are met.\n",
    "        - **Pearson correlation coefficient:** Used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables when the data are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Non-parametric**: When your data violates any of these assumptions, non-parametric tests are more suitable. Non-parametric tests are called “distribution-free tests” because they don’t assume anything about the distribution of the population data.\n",
    "        - Example: Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation coefficient\n",
    "        * **Wilcoxon signed-rank test:** Used to compare the medians of two related samples when the data are not normally distributed.\n",
    "        * **Mann-Whitney U test:** Used to compare the medians of two independent groups when the data are not normally distributed.\n",
    "        * **Kruskal-Wallis test:** Used to compare the medians of three or more groups when the data are not normally distributed.\n",
    "        * **Spearman correlation coefficient:** Used to measure the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two continuous variables when the data are not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Various kind of hypothesis testing\n",
    "Statistical tests come in three forms: \n",
    "1. **comparison test:** Comparison tests assess whether there are differences in means, medians or rankings of scores of two or more groups. To decide which test suits your aim, consider whether your data meets the conditions necessary for parametric tests, the number of samples, and the levels of measurement of your variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **correlation test:** Correlation tests determine the extent to which two variables are associated. Although Pearson’s r is the most statistically powerful test, Spearman’s r is appropriate for interval and ratio variables when the data doesn’t follow a normal distribution. The chi square test of independence is the only test that can be used with nominal variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **regression test:** Regression tests demonstrate whether changes in predictor variables cause changes in an outcome variable. You can decide which regression test to use based on the number and types of variables you have as predictors and outcomes. Most of the commonly used regression tests are parametric. If your data is not normally distributed, you can perform data transformations.Data transformations help you make your data normally distributed using mathematical operations, like taking the square root of each value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to test whether there is a difference in the average height of men and women. We collect a sample of 100 men and 100 women, and measure their heights. We want to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in height between men and women, against the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference.\n",

The p-value can be calculated using a t-distribution with 198 degrees of freedom (the sum of the sample sizes minus 2). Using a t-table or a statistical software, we find that the p-value is much less than 0.05 (in fact, it is practically 0), indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
