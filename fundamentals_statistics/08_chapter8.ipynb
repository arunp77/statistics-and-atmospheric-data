    "# 🧠 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** is a statistical method used to **compare the means of three or more groups** to determine if at least one group mean differs significantly from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "It extends the **t-test** (which compares two means) to **multiple groups** while controlling the **Type I error rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Intuitive Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of comparing means pairwise (like multiple t-tests), ANOVA compares **variability between groups** to **variability within groups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the **between-group variability** is **much larger** than the **within-group variability**, it suggests that the group means are **not all equal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = \\dots = \\mu_k \\quad \\text{(all group means are equal)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_a: \\text{At least one group mean is different}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 The ANOVA Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA divides the **total variation** in the data into two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source of Variation       | Description                          | Measured by    |\n",
    "| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |\n",
    "| **Between Groups**        | Differences due to group means       | $SS_{between}$ |\n",
    "| **Within Groups (Error)** | Random differences within each group | $SS_{within}$  |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 The F-statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The **F-statistic** measures the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MS_{between} = \\frac{SS_{between}}{df_{between}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad MS_{within} = \\frac{SS_{within}}{df_{within}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $SS$: Sum of squares\n",
    "* $df$: Degrees of freedom\n",
    "* $MS$: Mean square (average sum of squares)\n",
    "\n",
    "If $F$ is large, it indicates that group means differ more than expected by random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 One-Way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the means of **three or more groups** based on **one independent variable** (factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You test whether **three fertilizers** produce different average plant growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Group        | Mean Growth (cm) |\n",
    "| ------------ | ---------------- |\n",
    "| Fertilizer A | 12               |\n",
    "| Fertilizer B | 15               |\n",
    "| Fertilizer C | 18               |\n",

    "* $\\varepsilon_{ij}$: random error term (assumed normally distributed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Assumptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independence of observations\n",
    "2. Normal distribution within each group\n",
    "3. Homogeneity of variances (equal variances across groups)\n",

    "* Compare with critical F-value from F-distribution at significance level (e.g., α = 0.05)\n",
    "* If $F > F_{critical}$, reject $H_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Post-hoc Tests (if H₀ is rejected):**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find a significant difference, use post-hoc tests (e.g., **Tukey’s HSD**, **Bonferroni**) to identify **which groups differ**.\n",

    "It also allows testing for **interaction effects** between factors.\n",
