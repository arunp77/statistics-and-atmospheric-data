## What is Atmospheric Statistics?

Atmospheric Statistics applies statistical theory and data analysis to Atmospheric data — such as air and water quality, climate variables, ecological counts, or satellite observations. It focuses on understanding **uncertainty**, **variability**, and **patterns** in Atmospheric systems.

**Core questions addressed:**

* How certain are we about pollution levels in a city?
* How do rainfall, temperature, and vegetation interact?
* What is the confidence level in climate trend estimates?

**Key applications:**

* Climate change studies (trend analysis, anomaly detection)
* Water and air quality monitoring
* Atmospheric impact assessment
* Remote sensing data validation
